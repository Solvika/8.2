Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass, the customer, requested the development of a tool to assist new drivers in passing their written and driving exams on their first try. 
The system was developed so that various people may access different types of data. Additionally, users would have access to highly skilled in-class and touring professors.

What did you do particularly well?

For this project, I feel I have limited the goals to use cases. After collecting notes during interviews, I converted them into use cases and used include and extend to define the connections between them. I also did a great job of illustrating which features will be accessible to various individuals.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In all probability, I believe that learning more about the structure will benefit in the refining of my own design. This is due to the fact that I have two "alternative" segments inside a single "alternative" section. This would be represented by nested loops in a computer program, but I'm not sure whether they're permitted in a sequence diagram. If I were in charge, I would be more cautious while narrowing down the possibilities and making a selection.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I carefully watched the interview. I recorded anything they said that may be a deliverable. After establishing a list, I checked each item for external demands that software could fulfill. I ignored non-program requirements and focused on thematically related components. Studying vague issues like "security" gave me the right solution. I then had to incorporate them into the approach. I created use cases for the bare minimal capability to simplify them. To add complexity, I included and extended connections. Consider what people need to make something useful. Our project includes downloading protected content. "Premium" content without a password or tiered user structure is useless. Considering the end user throughout design saves time and makes customers happy.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I'm still learning software programming. I prioritize the whole list of needs. After that, I'll separate the system's parts. I occasionally utilize a UML Class Diagram, but usually I just write them down and go on to the process flowchart. After completing flowcharts and class designs, I can start programming. When I start coding, I forget great ideas I had while designing. Studying may need time. I sometimes code immediately. I want to use the activity diagram to show how features should work in the future. They're essential to your function's sucesss.
